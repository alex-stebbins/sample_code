# sample_code

This repository just contains some sample code I've written.

domain_precip.ipynb if rom a project on downscaling precipitation from global climate models. It is designed to:
 - Read in some data and regrid it
 - Define some sub-domains
 - Plot the topography with sub-domains and an example of the downscaling correction under Westerly winds
 - Map the mean annual precipitation and streamflow from different downscaling techniques and the deviation from the control run
